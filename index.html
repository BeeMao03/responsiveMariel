    <p>
      A profiterole, cream puff, or chou à la crème is a filled French choux
      pastry ball with a typically sweet and moist filling of whipped cream,
      custard, pastry cream, or ice cream. The puffs may be decorated or left
      plain or garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered
      sugar. Savory profiterole are also made, filled with pureed meats, cheese,
      and so on. These were formerly common garnishes for soups. The various
      names may be associated with particular variants of filling or sauce in
      different places.
